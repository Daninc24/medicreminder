# Medical Reminder System

A comprehensive medical appointment and reminder system designed to streamline healthcare management for both doctors and patients.

## Project Overview

This system was developed through a structured approach with six main phases:

### 1. Research & Planning
- Identified core features and requirements
- Defined user roles (doctors and patients)
- Established security and compliance requirements (HIPAA, GDPR)
- Created detailed project timeline and milestones

### 2. Design
- Designed user interfaces for both doctor and patient dashboards
- Created wireframes for appointment scheduling
- Designed reminder system workflows
- Planned notification system architecture

### 3. Architecture & Tech Stack
Selected technologies:
- Frontend: React.js with Redux for state management
- Backend: Node.js with Express
- Database: MongoDB
- Authentication: JWT
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- Additional tools: Socket.IO for real-time features

### 4. Development & Testing
Implemented features in the following order:

#### Backend Development
1. Basic Express server setup with middleware
2. User and appointment models with authentication
3. Authentication routes and middleware
4. Security measures (rate limiting, CORS)
5. Appointment management system
6. Patient management system
7. Reminder system

#### Frontend Development
1. React application setup with Redux
2. Authentication flow (login/registration)
3. Protected routes implementation
4. Dashboard components
5. Appointment scheduling system
6. Patient management interface
7. Real-time notifications

### 5. Deployment
- Set up production environment
- Configured security measures
- Implemented monitoring
- Established backup procedures

### 6. Monitoring, Feedback & Scaling
- Implemented analytics
- Set up error tracking
- Created feedback mechanisms
- Planned scaling strategies

## Deployment

### Docker

To deploy the system using Docker:

1. **Build the Docker images**:
```bash
docker-compose build
```

2. **Start all services**:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This will start the backend, frontend, and MongoDB services.

### Accessing the Application

- **Frontend**: http://localhost
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:5000

For production deployment, you should:
1. Use proper domain names
2. Set up SSL/TLS certificates
3. Configure proper security measures
4. Set up monitoring and logging
5. Implement backup strategies
